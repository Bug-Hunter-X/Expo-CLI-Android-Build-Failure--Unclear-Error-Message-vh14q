# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Unclear Error Message

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered while building Android APKs using the Expo CLI. The build process fails without providing detailed error information, making debugging difficult.

## Problem

The Expo CLI build process abruptly stops, generating a vague error message lacking specific details such as the failing file or line of code.  The error is inconsistent, sometimes occurring after several successful builds.

## Solution

The provided solution focuses on a series of troubleshooting steps rather than a single fix, as the root cause may vary.  These steps include:

1. **Cleaning the build cache:** This removes potentially corrupted temporary files.
2. **Checking for missing dependencies:**  Ensuring all project dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date.
3. **Inspecting the build logs:** Although often unclear, a thorough examination of the logs might reveal clues.
4. **Rebuilding the project from scratch:** A fresh build sometimes eliminates transient issues.
5. **Gradle issues:** Investigating potential configuration issues within the `android/build.gradle` files.

This repository serves as a demonstration of the problem and its potential solutions. While it doesn't provide a specific code fix (because the problem is not tied to specific code), the documented solutions are widely applicable to similar issues.
