This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process unexpectedly stops and produces a cryptic error message, making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause.  The error message usually lacks specific details about the failure point, such as a particular file or line of code. The issue often arises after seemingly successful builds, suggesting that it might be related to temporary files, build cache corruption, or transient issues with the build system itself.
